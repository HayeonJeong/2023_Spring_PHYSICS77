# Dart Game

A physics-based dart game simulation that incorporates concepts of projectile motion, air resistance, and probability distribution.

## Overview

This project implements a dart game where players can:
- Control the dart's trajectory by setting initial angles and velocity
- Experience realistic physics with air resistance
- Analyze probability distributions and expected values of scoring

## Features

### Physics Engine
- Projectile motion simulation
- Air resistance modeling using F=-kv
- 3D trajectory visualization using x-y-z plotting
- Configurable parameters:
  - Initial velocity
  - Launch angle
  - Dart angle

### Game Mechanics
- Dart board size: 22.55cm
- Multiple throwing attempts
- Score tracking and distribution analysis

## Game Controls
Players can adjust:
- Initial velocity (recommended: 6.5 m/s)
- Launch angle (recommended: 35°)
- Dart angle (recommended: 70°)

## Technical Details
The simulation incorporates:
- Gravity effects
- Air resistance calculations
- Statistical analysis of scoring patterns
- Probability distribution modeling

## Challenges Faced
